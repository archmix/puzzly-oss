# Triady Developer Portal

This module is a lightweight developer portal that provides a concise list of system resources like Topics, Caches, Apis and Tables aligned with architectural resources like Business Contexts and Modules (a.k.a Services in distributed systems)

## How to run it on your computer
This project uses docker compose to make development easier to contributors. 
If you need assistance to install docker and docker compose, please follow up this [official guide](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

After you get docker compose running in your machine, just open a terminal and execute
`docker-compose up`

When web server is ready and open for connections, you can put your browser to `http://localhost:4200`. If you are using windows or mac os, you need to point to docker machine ip instead of localhost.
